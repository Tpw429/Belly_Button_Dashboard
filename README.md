## Project Description
Roza has a partially completed dashboard that she needs to finish. She has a completed panel for demographic information and now needs to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer individually. Specifically, her volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if "Improbable Beef" identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

For each candidate, I have developed an interactive GitHub Pages link, which allows the user to manually select their target of interest. It lists important information for each user such as: demographic information for each user, the top 10 bacterial cultures found from the belly button, the amount of bacterial cultures per sample, and the amount of scrubs each week.
